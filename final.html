            First off, I know this class is changing into to two classes now,
            but I will say that it pushed me in a way of programming that I beleive
            brings the best out of motivated students who want to learn, key word "motivated"
            . One change I would make for this class are the labs. I think they are great. However, I would have
            one lab per week. I would make the lab longer and consistof a few
            different components. Which we started to this sort of at the end but I would
            have it all along.
        </p>

            Secondly, I would have the class push more at the beginning of the semester
            where the code is a little easier to understand and less like object oriented programming.
            I think if we really hit it hard with HTML and CSS we could have more time to spend on JS and
            React. I would keep the projects the same especially 2 and 3. I liked the
            building of a server than adding a front-end to it with React.
        </p>
        <p>When I signed up for this class I just thought "sure, I'll take this
            I don't have a choice really." This class has been one of my favorites I have
            taken at JMU. Although, I am applying to Data Science programs for masters. I
            have even started to create my own React program that shows off Data.

        <p>Thank you!</p>
