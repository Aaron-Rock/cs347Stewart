    <h1>Blog 3!</h1>
    <p>     For this blog I wanted to learn about the history of web development and when web pages started 
        showing flashy displays. Obviously, the internet was not really a common household service until the 1990's. 
        When the world wide web truly became for everyday people that is when larger comapnies saw the impact 
        they could have by commercializing web pages.
