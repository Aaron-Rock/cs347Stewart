    <p>     For this blog I wanted to learn about the history of web development and when web pages started 
        showing flashy displays. Obviously, the internet was not really a common household service until the 1990's. 
        When the world wide web truly became for everyday people that is when larger comapnies saw the impact 
        they could have by commercializing web pages. Because of businesses realizing the potential of marketing in 
        1990 HTML was created.

    With learning flexbox this past week the turn of the century also brought the language of CSS. CSS brings
     many things to development the on I believe is the most important is the ability to style each element tag
      from the HTML tags. With the 2000's bringing many innovations in the tech world. The web was increasingly 
      becoming more and more savy with flash video, animation, and media becoming more engraved in the CSS language.
