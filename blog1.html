    <p>So far, in Cs 347 we have focused mainly on HTML. The one analogy that really helped 
        me with how the structure of the language should be is the tree analogy. I am learning that HTML is 
        much more than what I initially thought. It is also a more sophisticated language than what it sounds like. HTML and CSS,
         for a business are extremely important to sales because it shows the aesthetics of what the brand is about.
