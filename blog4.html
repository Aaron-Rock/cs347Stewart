            Ahhhh good ole flexbox. I am learning that flexbox is a MONSTER of concept. 
            Learning this vital tool is more than just putting a dynamic box around a title. Its a tool that allows the 
            programmer the ability to customize the interface. Flexbox was designed to allow the programmer to be able to 
            move containers around on a one dimensional layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other tool that is similar to CSS's flexbox is CSS Grid. Grid is a new tool in the language. Now, there is 
            some debate on which is better and which one to use for certain cases when coding. One thing to note is 
            that for the most part Grid can do things that Flexbox does and Flexbox can do things that Grid can do.
            However, like I stated above Flexbox was huge for using a one-dimensional layout, but grid 
            can use a two-dimensional layout.
