        Welcome to Blog 2!

    <p>It is interesting just how valuable a good mobile and website correlates to the sales of a product on that company's site. 
        According to a Forbes article, studies show that if a consumer deems a website to not look well designed or function correctly the 
        there is a 46% decrease they will buy the product. What was facinating to me was the correlation between the quality of the website's function 
    and whether the consumer would proceed with purchases. It shows that functionality is just as important to the consumer than the aesthetic. On the 
first day we went over what a mobile display and desktop display would look like if the network is throttled down. My belief after reading this article is that 
you want to have some base line functions working even if the network is slower than anticipated. </p>

<p class="second">After reading and researching more articles about CSS and the importance of the language. I stumbled across SpinxDigital and how they 
    believe almost every employee should have some sort of knowledge of the language. The article states that understanding how the design is created and how 
    each attribute can change the website or mobile application.
